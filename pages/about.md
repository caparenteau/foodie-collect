## About the Collection

Trying new foods, and supporting local restaurants, is one the creator's favorite things in life. But it is sometimes tough scouring Yelp reviews and online menus for pictures to decide if a place is worth the trip (and hard-earned money!). This collection is designed to help guide the local "foodie". It includes:

- Entrees
- A few sides
- And of course dessert!
